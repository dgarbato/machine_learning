The notebook, "Outlier Check" identifies outliers in the data.

The notebook "prep strings, dummify, and train test split" 
	- removes outliers
	- keeps only residential properties 
	- imputes strings where appropriate
	- converts ordinal data coded as string into integers
	- creates dummies for use in linear models
	- splits the data into training and test.

The notebook, "EDA machine learning" contains the analysis:
	 to: determine:
		- how to impute numeric features, 
		- which transformations to use on continuous features
		- how to group the neighborhoods
	- to examine dummy and categorical features

The names of the notebooks for the 5 machine learning models is self explanatory.

The two tree model notebooks contain the code to prep the data as well as the models themselves.

"Correlations Analysis" notebook determines which features to exclude from the linear models.

"compare results" notebooks compares the results of the five models.

rs_regx_func_dict.py contains a function used in the tree models.
